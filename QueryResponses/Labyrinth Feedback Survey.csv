2022/10/29 10:12:46 PM GMT+11,19,She / her,1,Once a week,8,"Although the concept is very simple, it was fun to navigate through the maze and fight the monsters. I liked how we had to jump down to different levels to progress through the maze. I appreciated details such as the (button) sound effects, how the torches lit up as I passed them and how the monsters followed me even when I tried to run away. However, it was confusing how I couldn't tell what the bottles did. When I was at full health, I just seemed to pass through them, and it wasn't included in the instructions menu. Furthermore I personally found it difficult to fight the monsters in the sense that I could be clicking on the wrong spot and I couldn't see their health bar since some of them were too tall (but maybe that's just my skill issue) ",4,7,,9,,,7,,8,I like the overall theme it's cohesive,More variety in the environment eg. different wall textures,10,8,9,,
2022/10/30 2:26:57 AM GMT+11,21,He / him,17,Daily,7,"Played the game on Hard, played for about 40 mins and got a clear on my 3rd attempt. To start off with the good, I enjoyed the general aesthetic and atmosphere. The torches lighting up as you went through the maze was a nice detail as well, with the lighting against the labyrinth walls looking nice. I also enjoyed the mild upgrade system in the game regarding stamina and health, with the smaller health/stamina capsules increasing the maximum rather then healing, with the larger ones actually restoring HP. 

In terms of what I think needs improvement there are a few things. Firstly, on my first run I actively tried to fight enemies, however after clearing the first 2 floors I realised there was no real reason to actually fight enemies and it was faster, safer and more efficient to just sprint past enemies rather then actually fight. Perhaps having enemies drop items or beneficial power-ups would help make the enemies worth fighting. Secondly, I found that the orange and blue items just kind of did nothing. I'm not sure if I just missed it or didn't realise, but I don't think they actually did anything. So adding some kind of effect to them would be nice. Thirdly, I felt that the hit box for collecting consumables was actually quite small and I found more often then not that I actually ran past them rather then picked them up, meaning I had to run back to collect them (this time more slowly). In regards to the combat mechanics, I felt that general hit recognition could be improved, or more in terms of when it's registered. It would feel like at times that my hit on an enemy wouldn't be registered until after the full animation played, rather then when the weapon made active contact, which isn't helped by having the health bars of enemies tending to not be viewable since you need to be up close for attacks (since a lot of the enemies are tall and health bars were situated above their heads). This felt most apparent on the boss, where I wouldn't see the health decrease until after I had moved away from the enemy and could then actively see the health deplete. Speaking of the boss, it was fairly easy in comparison to the rest of the game where the boss had a clear identifiable pattern where the boss became a repeat of: move sideways around the boss, wait for fire ball charge up, dodge fireball by continuing to move sideways, go in for hit while still moving sideways, hit, move out while still moving sideways, repeat. Maybe adding an additional attack, that discourages this behavior would make it more interesting. Another small, but relevant point would be the player hitbox, where I'd sometimes feel it ""lagged"" behind me in a sense, where I'd get hurt by an enemy attack that happened after I already passed an enemy. Lastly, I feel like having some visual distinction between floors would be a nice touch in order to illustrate progress better. Maybe a floor with some moss growing or with chilly conditions, as I'd often forget how many floors I cleared due to how visually similar everything was.

Moving onto some more technical stuff, there are a few things I noticed. Firstly, I found that enemies tended to only generate at the very start of a floor, with maybe 1 or 2 spread out through the rest of the level. This produced an effect where I'd sometimes find 5 or 6 enemies grouped up in a single position (often around a corner) who would all fire at the same time as soon as I turned the corner, which resulted in my first 2 attempts ending in failure (both of which were on the second to last level). Another thing is that occasionally if I turned a corner too fast, or was navigating the level too quickly, enemies would disappear right in front of me and would return if I went back, I only saw this happen about 2-3 times, but it did happen. Lastly, I'd notice that torches would sometimes delay in lighting up, especially in longer hallways if I was sprinting down them.

Overall, the game has a very solid foundation for a rouge-like, and there was some obvious love for the genre among the production team. I enjoyed myself quite a bit which was evident by me finishing the game and not turning down the difficulty despite my first two failures. Keep up the good work and work on some last few things to improve it even more!",4,8,"Make enemies harder to run past, give reasons to actively fight them rather then dodging them, add more attacks then simple fireballs and make the final boss harder then simply running around them in circles waiting for the fireball and then going for a hit.",7,Running around trying to find the exit while being low on health and general supplies being spread out.,"Enemy spawns being generally clumped together made for unfair deaths on higher difficulties. For example, when turning some corners 5-6 enemies would be grouped that immediately started throwing fireballs with no chance for reaction. 

No real reason to fight enemies as it only served to deplete health with no reward, therefore, enemy item drops would be a nice addition. Maybe something like a currency that can be used on a shopkeeper at the start of each floor for upgrades etc.",4,"General movement and jumping was fine (although there didn't seem to be a need for the jump). However, combat is where the game felt the most clunky. Attacks didn't seem to register until after the full animation had finished, rather then on contact, which made it constantly feel like I'd missed, when I actually did in fact hit.",6,"The basic and repeated artstyle definitely made the game feel more like a hopeless labyrinth and aided to the constant feeling of getting lost as a lot of areas looked the same. The torches that lit up as you got closer to them also added to the atmosphere and the warm glow generated by them, helped to make the walls feel less bland.","Adding a distinct style to each floor would be a welcome change in making the player feel like they're actively making progress in the game, while still making the floor itself look the same to add to the ""getting lost"" aspect. Perhaps adding things like moss to some walls, or changing conditions such as heat or chill can help to make the game more visually distinct as players progress.",10,6,7,"As stated previously, adding reasons to fight enemies rather then just running away and making the process of running past them harder, I believe is the easiest and biggest way to make the game more fun and engaging, as at the moment, simply running past them is the way I believe most people will play and the most effective. However I stress that keeping items and health limited should also be kept as I believe combining necessary combat (with rewards) and limited supplies is what makes a rouge-like great from a difficulty and gameplay perspective.","Enemy generation being grouped at the start of levels rather then spread-out, with enemies often clumping into groups of 5-6 on top of each other, particularly around corners. Happened a lot on the last 2 floors. Enemies would sometimes disappear when turning corners too quick or simply navigating the level too quickly, but would return when backtracking. Only happened 2-3 times, but did occur. Sometimes torches would delay in lighting up when sprinting down longer corridors. "
2022/10/30 5:08:09 PM GMT+11,18,She / her,2,Once a year,8,"The graphics are quite nice. I enjoyed the lighting and ominous atmosphere, in accordance with the well-volumed music. I like the game concept and how there are different levels. Some things that I think should be improved are the 'how to play' instructions. They could be more clear, including a way to quit from the actual game, and illustrating the meaning behind the red and green bars, as well as the different bottles and what each of them do (in regards to bottles, I think it may also be beneficial for each to have a different colour). A backstory/meaning to the game would be valuable for players to read. Another thing that would be cool is for the minotaur level to have boss music to indicate that it is the last level.",5,5,"The easy mode was around a 1, there was not much to do there. I then tried the hardest mode and I found that one more of an enjoyable challenge. However, there is room for more monsters to be added as well as more bottles.The fighting and getting lost in the mazes are the main aspects that could be altered in determining the challenge level of the game.",7,It was fun to test out a game that was made from scratch. I enjoyed the concept of the game and the overall atmosphere. Also the skull at the end when a player dies is funny :),"As I said earlier, there could be more bottles and monsters. The maze felt quite empty at times and not much to do, which could make a player get bored or give up",9,"It was all fairly good, however I feel there was too much time before a player could attack. Gave the impression that it was delaying. Another thing is that the proximity in which you need to be to pickup an item could be increased so that it's easier to collect them (don't need to walk over multiple times to precisely get it)",8,"The lighting. The brightness was dim and ominous, matching the overall feel of the game",The brick walls feel quite repetitive. Perhaps it would be nice to see additions such as some cobwebs or splatters or cracks. ,10,7,6,Add more additions to the mazes and overall area to have it be less empty,I did not encounter any bugs
2022/10/30 6:35:39 PM GMT+11,19,She / her,7,Once a month,6,"Good. Nice graphics & sound effects.

2022/10/30 6:56:01 PM GMT+11,22,He / him,18,Daily,7,"The game has solid foundations and the textures and atmosphere of the game matches what I would expect from a FPS maze runner. I loved how torches would light up when you get close to them and then turn off. The sound effects chosen are adequate with nice balance. 

The game needs some improvements to the enemies spawning system as a it seems that all the enemies are generated at the start of the maze only and at the end it is pretty much dead with no enemies. 

I also noticed that there is actually no real reason to kill the enemies since you can just walk past them and go directly to the next level. 

The pickup was a hit hard to understand what they do and maybe explain to the players what are their purpose.

The Attack system could also be improved as it seems there is a delay after you attack the enemy and then when you see the enemy health decreasing.



",5,8,I think the a change could be having a purpose to actually kill the enemies as right now there is no need to kill the enemies.,8,Trying to go through the maze and remember where I came from ad try to find the exit was what was more fun for me.,"Try to have a way of making the enemies evenly distributed in the maze so that it is not that empty 

The attack delay seems a bit too high and could be reduce.

Make the enemies have a purpose so that there is a reason to kill them.


Tell the players what each potion do.
",7,movement was overall smooth and just the attack that needs some improvements. ,9,I really liked the look of the game. It feels mysterious and there the lighting works nice. ,,9,9,10,The game was very engaging to me since I love the puzzle solving idea of it and forced me to try to remember where I came from.,"No bugs found

2022/10/30 7:42:01 PM GMT+11,21,He / him,10,A few times a week,6,"I liked the atmosphere of the game, the SFX were spot on, and I definitely got lost a few times in the labyrinth. The monster models were all very cool, and the sprint bar worked which is cool. In terms of improvements, maybe making the instructions more clear as I kind of flicked through them, but when I got into the game it wasn't very intuitive that I wanted to fall down the holes in the ground. Also I dont know what the things I was collecting actually did? Maybe a counter to collect them all which opens a door to the next level would be cool. The combat is a little lackluster, but I suppose it is pretty difficult to make sword swinging fun. Other than that the game was pretty cool. The gameplay was to my perception bug free, everything seemed to have worked as it should have.",2,6,"I played on easy, but the Minotaur didn't really pose much of a threat, maybe if he charged at you and you jump out of the way that would be cool",7,"The immersion, it looked pretty realistic and sounded cool","Combat, maybe at the very least spawn more enemies, but make their health a lot less. So its satisfying to swing and kill things. Oooh yeah the death animation was satisfying.",8,Make the sword swipe a bit more visible,8,Immersive,Maybe use a few different textures,7,8,5,"See my answers previously. Definitely spawn more enemies, it feels a bit empty at times","I guess when I just stood there and attacked the minotaur and he attacked me back I didnt take any damage, I dont know if that is intended"
2022/10/30 8:44:39 PM GMT+11,22,He / him,9,Once a week,2,"Home Screen - hard to read font, however controls were intuitive. Animation for clicking ""start"" and going to the difficulty could be shorter.

Gameplay - It was a little bit weird that I couldn't see a sword right in front of me, but every time I clicked RMB a sword would just come whoosh, no pause menu, how do I pause the game? Also, I did not understand what the 'power ups' were used for, perhaps make that clearer in the gameplay. Sometimes when walking over them, they wouldn't be picked up, I would have to wait for a bit.  Enemy's do not walk into the 'hole' to the 'next level' is this a game design choice? Falling down through a hole could have been improved, perhaps stairs? Is there no fall damage?

World - Lots of dead space, seems too big for what it needs to be, a smaller map would give the player a more claustrophobic experience, which would add to the creepiness of the unexpected enemies popping up. 

Controls- Why add jumping as a functionality? I did not really seem to use that button a whole lot. 

Weapons - Perhaps add a ranged weapon, killing enemies seems like a chore, and always having to look up to see their health bar was quite annoying. Adding some sort of defensive weapon like a shield to block the ranged attacks might make the game more interactive and add some depth.

Enemies - Do enemies only have range attack and no melee attack? seems like a rather odd design choice

HUD - took me a while to understand what the green bar was, perhaps add a text like 'sprint' capacity, or a picture of shoes, or someone running



",5,5,"Nothing, I think its at a good spot, with the ability to change the difficulty, although I think th easy one is VERY easy, and normal is like a massive jump up",2,"Exploring the world, discovering new enemies, but after a few minutes, it got quite repetitive ","Maze was quite dull and boring, add different type of weapons, splash screen every time player walks on to a 'power up' and it explain what it does.
